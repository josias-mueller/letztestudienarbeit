\begin{abstract}
There are many different types of spatial indices, in this work two of them, namely \textit{HPRTree} and \textit{R*Tree} are compared in regards to their size in memory, the time it takes to build an index and the time it takes to delete it again. And how fast they can retrieve elements based on the type of query. For this many different datasets are used - most of which are newly generated for this purpose. In the end, the tests show the \textit{HPRTree} to be superior with regards to all but the query performance where the \textit{R*Tree} outshines.
